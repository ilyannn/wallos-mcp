# Security Review - Wallos MCP Server

## Date: 2025-08-21

## Security Audit Results

### Dependencies
✅ **No vulnerabilities found** - `bun audit` reports clean dependencies

### Code Security Analysis

#### 1. Credential Management
✅ **Secure** - Credentials properly handled via environment variables
- API key, username, and password never logged
- Session cookies managed in memory only
- No hardcoded secrets in codebase

#### 2. Authentication
✅ **Dual-mode authentication implemented**
- API key for read operations (existing security)
- Session-based auth for write operations
- Lazy session loading (only when needed)
- Session expiry handling

#### 3. Input Validation
✅ **Protected operations**
- Category ID 1 cannot be modified or deleted
- All user inputs validated before API calls
- Type checking enforced via TypeScript

#### 4. Error Handling
✅ **No sensitive data leakage**
- Error messages don't expose internal details
- Stack traces not sent to clients
- Debug output redirected to stderr only

#### 5. Network Security
✅ **HTTPS support**
- Configurable base URL supports HTTPS
- Session cookies with secure flag support
- 30-second timeout for all requests

### Linting & Type Safety
✅ **Comprehensive checks**
- ESLint configured for security best practices
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Test files included in linting
- All type errors resolved

### Testing Coverage
✅ **67 tests passing**
- Authentication flow tested
- Error scenarios covered
- Edge cases handled
- Session management validated

## Recommendations

1. **Future Enhancements**
   - Consider adding rate limiting
   - Implement request signing for API calls
   - Add audit logging for mutations

2. **Deployment Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Store credentials in secure vault
   - Enable CORS restrictions
   - Regular dependency updates

## Conclusion

The implementation follows security best practices:
- No exposed credentials
- Proper error handling
- Input validation
- Type safety
- Comprehensive testing

**Security Status: ✅ APPROVED**
